To address the vague Gradle error during Expo Android builds, a systematic debugging approach is required:

1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```

2. **Check the full log:**  Carefully examine the entire build log for more specific error messages or warnings that might be hidden within the initial output.  Look for hints about versions or dependencies causing conflicts.

3. **Verify Gradle and AGP versions:**  Ensure you're using compatible versions of Gradle and the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP). Consult the official Expo documentation for recommended versions. Consider upgrading or downgrading if inconsistencies exist.

4. **Examine `gradle.properties` and `android/app/build.gradle`:** Check the configuration files to ensure that the necessary dependencies and their versions are correctly specified and do not conflict.  Look for outdated plugins or deprecated settings.

5. **Check dependencies:** Ensure all your project dependencies are compatible.  Run `expo install` to make sure packages are up to date and consistent.

6. **Invalidate caches (Android Studio):** If using Android Studio, try invalidating caches and restarting.

7. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Use a dependency analysis tool to check for potential conflicts among your project dependencies.

8. **Create a minimal reproduction:** If the issue persists, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem from other project-specific factors.
