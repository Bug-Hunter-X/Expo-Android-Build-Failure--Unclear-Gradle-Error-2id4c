This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with a cryptic message, often related to Gradle or Android build tools. The error message itself is usually not very informative, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.  The underlying issue might be related to mismatched versions of Gradle, Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), or other dependencies.
