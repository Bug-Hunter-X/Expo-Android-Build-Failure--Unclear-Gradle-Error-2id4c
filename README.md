## Expo Android Build Failure: Unclear Gradle Error

This repository demonstrates a common but frustrating issue when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails with a vague Gradle error, lacking sufficient details for effective debugging.

**Problem:**
The Expo CLI build process for Android terminates unexpectedly, usually with a generic Gradle error message. The error message often doesn't point to the exact cause, leading to significant troubleshooting time.

**Solution:**
This repository provides potential solutions, including:

* Cleaning the project cache.
* Verifying and updating Gradle, AGP, and other dependencies to compatible versions.
* Checking for conflicting dependencies.
* Investigating the full log for additional clues.

This problem is often challenging to solve due to the uninformative error messages.  Each case may need unique debugging strategies depending on the project's configuration.

This issue has been reported in various Expo community forums, suggesting it's a relatively common problem lacking a single, definitive solution.
